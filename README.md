Fell in love with web3 and currently working as a blockchain developer to build an NFT marketplace on top of the Hedera hashgraph ecosystem. Will write smart contracts using Solidity in Ethereum and deploy them to the main net and test net. Worked on various NFT marketplace and Decentralised Finance projects. Enthusiastic and ready to work in a team, quick learner, and self-motivated. My strong problem-solving skills allow me to analyze problems by breaking down their components. Ability to learn and adapt new skills quickly. Excellent interpersonal communication skills as well as the ability to manage multiple responsibilities effectively.
